blog-rpncalc
============

This project contains a set of JVM implementations of a reverse-polish style calculator.  They are written to be used as supporting materials for a set of blog postings on the [KSM Partners Blog](http://www.ksmpartners.com/blog/). As such, while you are welcome use this code as the basis for other projects, it will need work to add error handling, logging, unit tests, and many of the other attributes desirable in production quality code.
