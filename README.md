============

# What is this?

This project contains a set of JVM implementations of a reverse-polish
style calculator.  They are written to be used as supporting materials
for a set of blog postings on the
[KSM Partners Blog](http://www.ksmpartners.com/blog/). As such, while
you are welcome use this code as the basis for other projects, it will
need work to add error handling, logging, unit tests, and many of the
other attributes desirable in production quality code.
